## Adapter pattern

- The adapter pattern allows classes that have different interfaces (properties/methods of an object) to work together. It translates the interface for a class to make it compatible with another class.

### when to use
- The adapter pattern is used when we need old APIs to work with new refactored ones or when an object needs to cooperate with a class that has an incompatible interface. 
- It can also be used to reuse the existing functionality of classes.
