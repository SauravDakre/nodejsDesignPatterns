# Strategy Design Pattern

# Problem:
- how to configure a class with a algorithm at run time
- how can algorithm be selected and exchanged at run time

# Solution:
- Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
